# Preserved local changes for v0.8.2

Checked on 2026-10-25 against the latest published release v0.8.1, fork main
at `4020a1cc`, the complete release range, the local worktree and branches, all
six preserved stashes, and the ctty7-related temporary patches.

| Preserved source | Finding and disposition |
| --- | --- |
| `fix/compact-preview-native-tooltips` at `48f5eed6` | Patch-equivalent to merged cloudy-liu/ctty7#204 at `4020a1cc`; included in this release. The branch and its original commit remain preserved. |
| Current direct-titlebar and flat-preview changes at `7bc97356` | Included through release PR cloudy-liu/ctty7#205 with matched native Windows screenshots and rendered interaction coverage. The shared 28px titlebar geometry and 24px preview target are retained. |
| Historical remote `feat/titlebar-direct-actions` | Earlier implementation and menu-only revision remain preserved. The current release branch restores the later requested direct-entry behavior without rewriting that historical branch. |
| Six stashes from `9c1dc9ea` through `c73bcbb4` | Hashes and descriptions match the previous release audit. Their included, superseded, or intentionally archived dispositions remain as recorded in the [v0.8.1 audit](local-change-audit-v0.8.1.md); none were dropped or applied. |
| Temporary `ctty7-12ec.patch` and `ctty7-5c45.patch` | The previously audited Git-status recovery patches remain preserved and introduce no additional release behavior. |
| `target/tmp/titlebar-direct-actions` | Contains local validation binaries, fixture options, and PR/commit text. Durable acceptance screenshots are committed under `docs/testing/images/titlebar-direct-actions`; local binaries and scratch configuration are excluded from the release source. |

Only the main checkout is registered as a worktree. The earlier closeout bundle
under `.git/archives/closeout-20261024` remains preserved. No stashes, historical
tags, or published assets are removed or rewritten during this release.

The complete range from v0.8.1 includes the document-preview and native-tooltip
changes in #204, the direct titlebar and transparent preview control in #205,
and release version/documentation updates. Patch-equivalent source already
merged in #204 is counted once. No history-only synchronization is presented
as new product behavior.

See [the English release notes](../releases/v0.8.2.md) and
[titlebar acceptance](titlebar-direct-actions.md) for the delivered behavior and
remaining verification limits. Source CI, package verification, downloaded
assets, and checksums must pass before the draft release is published.
